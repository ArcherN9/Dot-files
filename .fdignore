# The fdignore file works like .gitignore files, but are specific to fd. 
# This can be placed in the ~ directory and regex patterns filter out unwanted 
# files.

# On a Mac system, the Library is the system folder which keeps important support
# files, such as user account settings, preference files, containers, application
# scripts, caches, cookies, fonts and other service files.

# Inside Unity projects, the meta files are used to store GUIDs of each file
# craeted. These are required by Unity and the user need not bother with them.
# fd does honour .gitignore but these .meta files should be committed to 
# source code respositories too. Hence, they are ignored from FZF and FD on a
# global scale

# .Unity files should only be edited via the Unity editors.
