# Context

The Linux system being worked upon is actually a Pixel 7 device. Resources are scarce and all modifications, installation and configuration changes we perform must be weighed for performance and utility trade offs. This linux system has an SSH server and a VNC server installed that lets a user log in from their work Mac device which is locked down due to organizational governance policies. From that perspective, the ability to login to a portable Linux desktop un hindered from restrictions is a boon.
